					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>
						Welcome to the home of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. The driver allows Java programs to connect to a
						PostgreSQL database using standard, database independent Java code. It is a pure Java (Type IV)
						implementation, so all you need to do is download a jar file and you're on your way.
					</p>
				
					<hr />
					<h1>Features</h1>
					<p>
						The driver provides a reasonably complete implementation of the JDBC 3 specification in addition
						to some PostgreSQL specific extensions. Our goal is nothing short of full compliance, but we're not
						there yet. Some features require additional backend support and others just need someone to implement
						them. For a list of what still needs to be done see our <a href="../development/todo.html">Todo</a>
						list.
