      <title>About Multiple Repositories</title>
      <p>
        The JDBC driver was originally part of the main server distribution's
	source tree and was maintained there until the 8.0 release.  Some
	members of the server's steering committee wanted to reduce the
	bulk of the package and their responsibility in maintaining the
	various non-server pieces.  This resulted in all interfaces being
	removed from the server source tree.  The JDBC driver moved to the
	<a href="http://gborg.postgresql.org/project/pgjdbc/projdisplay.php">gborg</a>
	site.  It is still developed by the same people, basically the only
	real change is a different cvs repository, which should be pretty
	low impact because I imagine most people just use pre-built
	jar files.
