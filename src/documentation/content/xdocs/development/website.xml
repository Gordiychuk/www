      <title>Building the Website</title>
      <p>
        The website is produced with
	<a href="http://forrest.apache.org">Apache Forrest</a>.
	It allows you to build a reasonably good looking website without
	a whole lot of work.  There's no need to develop your own menu and
	template system.  You provide the content and it draws the interface
	around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is currently built with Forrest version 0.5.1.  Please read
	the <a href="http://forrest.apache.org">Forrest website</a> for
	installation instructions.  After installing Forrest you need to get
	the website project.  This is available from the same
	<a href="site:cvs">cvs repository</a> that the main source code is,
	it's just a different module, <code>www</code>.  Check this out,
	go into that directory, and type <code>forrest</code>.  This should
	produce a copy of the website in the <code>build/site</code>
	subdirectory.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a couple of pieces of the website that are not built with
	Forrest, notably the Javadoc API documentation and the downloads.
	These are produced from the source code itself.

      <title>Adding a Page</title>
      <p>
        To add a page the easiest thing to do is copy an existing one from
	<code>src/documentation/content/xdocs</code> and ripping out its
	content.  Then you need to add the new file to the menu system
	listed in <code>site.xml</code>.  A good place to look for examples
	is <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Forrest's</a> own site and
	the source it comes from,
	<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/src/documentation/content/xdocs/">their subversion repository</a>.
