      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Here is a collection of things that may be useful to you that
        are not part of the core driver.  For assistance or support you
        should contact the channels specified in each item, instead of
        the core driver lists/team.

      <title>Statement Caching Wrapper</title>
      <p>Wraps the core driver to enable caching of PreparedStatement
        objects.  Not all application servers support this functionality
        in their connection pools and not all applications are deployed
        onto application servers.

      <title>Copy Interface</title>
      <p>The core driver currently does not support the COPY command and
        while we have every intention of doing that eventually we haven't
        gotten around to it yet.
