        Welcome to the home of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.  It allows Java
	programs to connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database
	independent Java code.  It is a pure Java (Type IV) implementation,
	so all you need to do is <a href="site:download">download</a> a jar
	file and you're on your way.

      <p>
        The driver provides are reasonably complete implementation of the
	JDBC 3 specification in addition to some PostgreSQL specific
	extensions.  Our goal is nothing short of full compliance, but
	we're not there yet.  Some features require additional backend
	support and others just need someone to implement them.  For
	a list of what still needs to be done see our
	<a href="site:todo">todo list</a>.
