      <p>I am rather oblivious about the history of the driver before
         the 7.2 release and who should be credited for it.  As far as I
	 can tell it was originally developed by Peter Mount and Adrian Hall.
	 If you know better please let us know.

        People who have contributed significant code to the project.  These
	are just those I could recall from the past year without an
	endless poring over old emails and commit messages.  If you've
	been forgetten, don't hesitate to let us know about it.
